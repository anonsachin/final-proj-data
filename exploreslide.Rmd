This is a couple of slides explaining the data product developed in the same repository. It is product for project,
this product is used to look into examples of how data from a dataset can be represented and how you can go throught the different 
variables of the dataset and look at their relationships with each other.

## Reasons to use the prodeuct

- To see how data can be represented 
- Get an idea about the relationships of the diiferent variables
- Use later for analysis to b e performed on different datasets

## Look at the data sets used
```{r cars, echo = F}
str(mtcars)
```

## iris dataset

```{r pressure}

```
